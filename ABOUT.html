                        <p>I believe that gardens have the power to lift the spirits at any time of year, finding a rose on Christmas day, watching spring unfold week by week or finding the perfect spot for a glass of wine with friends.  It is great hearing feedback from clients about how they are using their ‘new’ gardens and how much more they enjoy their outdoor space.  It is my mission to understand the clients needs, both now and how they may change in the future and to create a space which also reflects their style and the character of their property and its surroundings.  All aspects of the design process are fascinating, and I am particularly interested in plants, in their selection and combination and using them to create habitats and to tell a story.</p>
                        <p>It is important to me to retain contact with clients in the early stages of the establishment of the garden.  Once the garden is built, I revisit to be on hand to answer queries and to offer advice on the formative stages of the planting, it matters to me that my clients are happy with how the garden is developing.</p>
                        <p>Learning about plants and the natural world never stops and I love observing plants in their natural environment and using those observations to use plants better in clients gardens.  I have been gardening for most of my life and see it as a great vehicle for exercise, reflection and creativity (with occasional frustration thrown in), my greatest pleasures in my own garden are watching the other creatures which call my garden home enjoying it too, bees foraging, birds nest building, and my teenage children bringing their friends to relax.</p>
