                            <p>Green spaces have never been more important to us all as a source of solace, reassurance and inspiration.  Everyone with a garden has a chance to make a positive difference to their own surroundings and to give nature a helping hand and increasing biodiversity.  Gardens can offer moments of magic and wonder at any time of year and my designs take into account the British climate and the celebrate the changing seasons.</p>

                            <p>With every client, my aim is to increase their enjoyment of their outdoor space.  I really listen to what clients want to achieve from their garden and reflect the clients’ style and set the garden in its historic context and geographical location, so it is my design but telling my clients’ story.</p>

                            <p>Unlike interior design, gardens change with time and my aim is to design gardens with good structure which improve with age, by choosing plants which are appropriate for the setting, and designing for the long-term.</p>

                            <p>Learning about plants and the natural world never stops and I love observing plants in their natural environment and using those observations to use plants better in clients gardens.  I have been gardening for most of my life and see it as a great vehicle for exercise, reflection and creativity (with occasional frustration thrown in), my greatest pleasures in my own garden are watching the other creatures which call my garden home enjoying it too, bees foraging, birds nest building, and my teenage children bringing their friends to relax.</p>

                            <p>I have been gardening for most of my life and see it as a great vehicle for exercise, reflection and creativity (with occasional frustration thrown in), it is a real joy to share this enthusiasm with clients and to stay in information to offer advice as the garden matures.</p>
